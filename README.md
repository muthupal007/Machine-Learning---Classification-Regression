UB CSE574 - Introduction to Machine Learning 
In this assignment, we have performed classification and regression techniques on the given data (Diabetes). The results and their interpretation are discussed in this report
The following experiments were performed:
1. Gaussian Discriminators
2. Linear Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Ridge Regression using gradient descent
5. Non-Linear Regression
6. Logistic Regression:
	a) Binary Logistic Regression
	b) Direct Multi-class Logistic Regression
7. Support Vector Machines
